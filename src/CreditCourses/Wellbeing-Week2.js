                This week, Professor Santos showed visual illusions to make a point about how humans think. The illusion below, the Ponzo Illusion, was left out. If you‚Äôre like most people you will see the line on the right as longer, even though the two red lines are the same length (Go ahead and measure them if you don‚Äôt believe it). The illusion works because the distance cues provided by black lines trick our brains into thinking that the right line is ‚Äúfurther away‚Äù and should be bigger.<br />

                Which of the follow statements align with what Professor Santos covered in lecture? "Check all that apply"<br /><br />

                &nbsp;<strong class='ans'>a: Our minds strongest intuitions are often wrong<br /></strong>
